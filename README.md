# Hi there! 👋 
## 🚀About me
🎓 I completed my Bachelor's degree in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. My journey in the tech world has fueled a strong passion for data analysis, and I am eager to build a career as a **Data Analyst**.

📊 Over the past year, I have completed projects in predictive analytics, object detection, and recommendation systems. These experiences have honed my skills in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and machine learning, using tools like Python, R, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow.

Outside the world of tech, I enjoy exploring new hobbies and skills. My interests lie in sketching. I also have a knack for creative writing and often pen down my thoughts and experiences.

📚 I am an avid reader with a particular interest in personal development, data science, and visualization literature. One of my favorite books is "Storytelling with Data - **A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals"** by **Cole Nussebaumer Knaflic**.
