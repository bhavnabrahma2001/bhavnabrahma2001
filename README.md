# Hi there! 👋 
## 🚀About me
🎓 I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. My journey in the tech world has fueled a strong passion for data analysis, and I am eager to build a career as a **Data Analyst**.

These experiences have honed my skills in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and machine learning, using tools like Python, R, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow.

Outside the world of tech, I enjoy exploring new hobbies and skills. My interests lie in sketching. I also have a knack for creative writing and often pen down my thoughts and experiences.
